# Project
Optimization of Lot Sizing Problem for Injection Molding Machines at Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (BMW)

-Explanation of the Dataset

The process studied occurs in two stages 

i) Injection Molding 

ii) Paint shop. 

• There are 22 parts which are produced on 7 Injection Molding machines. 

• Machines are assumed to produce only one part at a time and for the functioning of our problem we consider single working machines and not parallel working machines. 

• Average set up costs for each machine is provided. 

• The production process takes place in three shifts for Induction Molding namely 
i) Night shift 
ii) Early shift
iii) Late shift  

• Three shifts for for the Paint Shop namely 
i) Early Shift 
ii) Late Shift  

• The night shift pays most at euro 50, while the early and late shift pay 35 euro and 40 euros respectively. 

• The Injection Molding process and the Paint shop work takes place from Monday to Friday according to our data. 

• The operational timings for the workshop are 6-15.30 hours for the early shift and 15.30-1.00 hour for the late shift.
